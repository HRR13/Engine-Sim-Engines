# Engine-Sim-Engines
Engine model file, from Engine Simulator by AngeTheGreat
Engine models for [Engine Sim by Ange Yaghi](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/engine-sim/).

Some of these engines were custom build, and gathered from multiple engine model file and specifications across the internet. Feel free to adjust the engine whatever you wish for, or maybe use it to improvise the engine based on your knowledge.

Put the files under \assets\engines\ or \assets\engines[your own engine folder name] and type the appropriate path into main.mr and everything should work just fine!
